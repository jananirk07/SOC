This is documentation for SOC 2025 - ID 114 - Building an RL Agent: Kungfu Master.
In week 1, we've learnt regression models and did an assignment training our very own data from sample training data in kaggle.
For week 2's project, we used algorithms like Greedy Decoding, Thompson Sampling and UCB to implement an algorithm aimed at principally cracking the multi-armed monster bandit.
